## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). My research interests lie in Explainable AI(XAI), emphasizing large language models(LLMs). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [the University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/).


## Research Interests

**Explainable AI**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Interpretability**, **Data Mining**
